### Introducing Eviden

Eviden is an Atos business that brings together its digital, cloud and big data & security business lines. It will be a global leader in data-driven, trusted and sustainable digital transformation. A next-generation digital business, Eviden stems from worldwide leading positions in digital, cloud, data, advanced computing and security.

The Elastic Data Analytics team is an enthusiastic team of professionals that enjoys creating solutions for customers with Elastic Stack, from observability to SIEM, from APM to website, application, and workplace search. We excel in exotic use cases, connecting and integrating structured, semi-structured and unstructured data sources into one data lake: Elastic. 

We developed a smart mid-server concept with queuing and message bus capabilities as a point of presence in customer networks. And we developed a lot of custom parsers for all kinds of log sources. Like if you want an Enterprise Log Management solution without paying top price.

We consult, we build, and we deliver managed services around every aspect of the Elastic Stack.

We hope to speak to you soon!
